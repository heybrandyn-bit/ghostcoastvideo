  <!-- PRE-HEADLINE -->
  <p class="pre-headline">Attention: Ambitious Professionals Who Want Into Tech</p>

  <!-- MAIN HEADLINE -->
  <h1 class="main-headline">
    Your Fastest Pathway to a<br>
    <span class="highlight">$100,000 Career</span><br>
    in the Tech Industry
  </h1>

  <!-- SUB-HEADLINE -->
  <p class="sub-headline">
    Become the face of a real engineering team — without writing a single line of code, managing developers, or building anything yourself.
  </p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- OPENING COPY -->
  <p>Dear Future Account Lead,</p>

  <p>What if you could walk into any room — any boardroom, any networking event, any LinkedIn DM — and introduce yourself as the front person for a <strong>real, producing tech team</strong>?</p>

  <p>Not a "business opportunity." Not a course. Not some vague partnership where you're left figuring everything out on your own.</p>

  <p class="bold-line">A real role. Real projects. Real income. Real résumé.</p>

  <p>That's exactly what we're offering here — and if you're the right fit, this single page could change the trajectory of your entire career.</p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: THE PROBLEM -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">Here's the Problem With <span class="hl-red">"Breaking Into Tech"</span></h2>

  <p>Everyone says "learn to code." Go get a bootcamp certificate. Build a portfolio. Apply to 500 jobs and pray.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the people actually making money in tech? <strong>They're not all coders.</strong> Half of them are the ones who know how to talk to clients, close deals, and manage relationships.</p>

  <p>The industry doesn't have a shortage of developers. It has a shortage of people who can <em>sell the work, manage the client, and show up as a professional.</em></p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>That's the gap we're filling.</strong> We have the engineering. We have the delivery pipeline. We have the portfolio. What we need is <strong>you</strong> — on the front lines, talking to decision-makers, opening doors.
  </div>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: WHAT THIS IS -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">What <span class="hl-yellow">This Actually Is</span></h2>

  <p>Ghost Coast Video is a production and engineering team that builds real software for real businesses:</p>

  <ul class="bullet-stack">
    <li>AI tools and automation systems</li>
    <li>SaaS platforms and dashboards</li>
    <li>Mobile applications</li>
    <li>E-commerce builds and integrations</li>
    <li>Fintech and healthtech projects</li>
    <li>Custom CRMs, internal tools, chatbots</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We're looking for a small, curated group of <strong>Account Leads</strong> — professionals who serve as the client-facing front of the operation.</p>

  <p>You don't manage developers. You don't run sprints. You don't debug code at 2 AM.</p>

  <p class="bold-line">You open doors. We deliver the product. Everyone gets paid.</p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: YOUR ROLE -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">Your Role as an <span class="hl-yellow">Account Lead</span></h2>

  <p>This is what your day-to-day looks like:</p>

  <ul class="bullet-stack">
    <li>Show up to 3–4 interviews and client meetings per month</li>
    <li>Interface with HR departments and hiring managers</li>
    <li>Represent the team professionally in all client-facing conversations</li>
    <li>Build your professional network and résumé with every engagement</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Here's the thing — this isn't a grind.</strong> Our team works aggressively behind the scenes to source and schedule your interviews. You're not cold-calling. You're not prospecting. You're not doing outreach at midnight. We get you in the room — you just need to <em>show up and perform.</em>
  </div>

  <p>You handle the interview. You interface with HR. Our team handles <strong>everything else</strong> — the technical delivery, the project execution, the backend work. You're the face. We're the engine.</p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: THE NUMBERS -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">Let's Talk <span class="hl-yellow">Real Numbers</span></h2>

  <p>We're not going to promise you'll be rich next month. That's not what this is. Here's what the compensation actually looks like:</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>$150/month base retainer</strong> — paid monthly, regardless of project volume.<br><br>
    <strong>10% commission</strong> on every gig over $1,000 — and these projects regularly land in the $5K–$50K+ range.
  </div>

  <p>Will you get wealthy overnight? <strong>No.</strong> And anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.</p>

  <p>But here's what you <em>will</em> get — and this is the part most people miss:</p>

  <h2 class="section-headline">The <span class="hl-red">Real</span> Payoff</h2>

  <p class="bold-line">A portfolio of actually successful, delivered tech projects — with your name on them.</p>

  <p>Think about what that means for your career. Every project you lead becomes a line item on your résumé. Every client relationship becomes a reference. Every engagement proves you can operate at a professional level in the tech industry.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>This is what happens:</strong> Your job applications start getting returned. Recruiters start reaching out. You're no longer "trying to break into tech" — you're someone with a <em>track record</em> of leading real engagements while you train for the exact role you want.
  </div>

  <p>The $150/month and the 10% commissions? That's your income floor while you build. The portfolio, the network, the résumé? <strong>That's the asset that pays you for years.</strong></p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: VS THE ALTERNATIVES -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">Compare That to the <span class="hl-red">Alternatives</span></h2>

  <p class="objection">"I'll go to a coding bootcamp for $15K and hope someone hires me in 6 months..."</p>
  <p class="objection-answer">Or you could be building a real portfolio <em>this month</em> — and getting paid while you do it.</p>

  <p class="objection">"I'll apply to 200 tech jobs and compete with 10,000 other applicants..."</p>
  <p class="objection-answer">Or you could have actual delivered projects on your résumé when you apply.</p>

  <p class="objection">"I'll start my own agency and figure out hiring, delivery, ops..."</p>
  <p class="objection-answer">Or you could plug into a team that already has all of that running and focus on what you're good at.</p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: WHAT YOU GET -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">Here's What You Walk Away With — <span class="hl-yellow">Even Beyond the Money</span></h2>

  <ul class="bullet-stack">
    <li><strong>A real tech résumé</strong> — "Account Lead at a software engineering firm" looks different than anything else you could put on LinkedIn</li>
    <li><strong>Access to top decision-makers</strong> — You'll be speaking with CEOs, founders, and department heads</li>
    <li><strong>Industry credibility</strong> — Backed by a team that actually ships production software</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — Remote, async, work from anywhere. Fit this around your existing career or build it into your main thing</li>
    <li><strong>No ceiling</strong> — The more doors you open, the more you earn. No salary cap. No waiting for a promotion.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: WHO THIS IS FOR -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">Who This Is <span class="hl-red">Perfect</span> For</h2>

  <ul class="bullet-stack">
    <li>Salespeople who want to sell something with real substance</li>
    <li>Account managers looking for a higher-earning model</li>
    <li>Consultants who already talk to business owners daily</li>
    <li>Agency owners who want to add tech services without building a dev team</li>
    <li>Freelancers with existing client relationships</li>
    <li>Career changers who want into tech <em>without</em> learning to code</li>
    <li>Anyone with a network of business owners and the confidence to pick up the phone</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="divider">

  <!-- SECTION: HOW IT WORKS -->
  <h2 class="section-headline">How It Works — <span class="hl-yellow">3 Steps</span></h2>

  <p><strong>Step 1: Apply Below</strong><br>
  Tell us about yourself, your background, and what kind of clients you have access to.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 2: Intro Call</strong><br>
  We'll hop on a short call to see if it's a mutual fit. No pressure, no pitch — just a real conversation.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 3: Start Opening Doors</strong><br>
  Once you're in, we'll equip you with everything you need — positioning, talking points, project examples — and you start reaching out to your network.</p>

  <div class="guarantee">
    <h3>NO RISK. NO COST. NO CATCH.</h3>
    <p>There's no buy-in. No fee. No inventory. You're not purchasing anything.<br>

    <p><strong>P.S.</strong> — You don't need a tech background. You don't need a degree. You don't need to know what an API is. You need to be someone who can have a professional conversation, identify an opportunity, and follow through. We handle <em>everything</em> else.</p>

    <p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> — Think about where you'll be in 12 months. Still scrolling job boards? Still "thinking about" getting into tech? Or actually doing it — with real projects, real clients, and real income on your résumé. The choice is yours.</p>
